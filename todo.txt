// TODO:
// - Adding new AIs from the AI's own update() will mess up the iterator. Need to look at how i create new stuff, and create a stack of new stuff to add after the loop.
	- if update() is the only place this can happen then i can mitigate easy enough i guess
	- can actually do everything apart from the push_back in update, and then do that after the loop. that should work.
// - real units. Thrust in Newtons, mass in kg, etc.
// - Find out why it is not framerate independent. fix that. the game is very slow at less than 300ish fps.
// - Visibility edges: disregard objects outside of screen. Use rectangle-rectangle collision detection.
// - multiple light sources (realistically maximum 1 other source due to speed, but support for more)
// - expand render(), to a separate class or whatever, but AI and anything should be able to draw stuff ad-hoc, but into a zoomed and translated world. 


// - Need a way to send keypresses to AI's. Wait, I have that... world pointer works now.
// - Test object with gravity as a force, cover the whole world.
// - Test that AI players can shoot lasers at me.
	// todo: when they're dead, lasers still remain. Need to draw a tree structure of what's really going on in shape/ai-creation, and how to kill it properly.
	// todo: that whatever-it-is bug when you exit the game afterwards. Maybe need to add all objects properly via "objToAdd" vector
// - Guided missile - Liero style (to test change of user_controlled_shape and inputs)
// - Zoom in and out. Do at the same time as moving world.
// - Once i have framerate etc figure out: add a button to slow down time. Option to compensate by higher speed after. (time-warp facilitator powerup..?)
	// - get that sound from  SlowMoGuys when they slow down time.
// - proper bounce from walls
// - handle large triangles and circles (bounce, ninja rope, ..) - think circles as walls. not sure how that will work. test it.
// - ninja rope latch on walls (in the correct place) (will have same problem for other larger objects)
// - Starry background done. Do sprite as background, like in some olc video..?
// - Quad tree
// - rotational physics. (angular momentum, torque, etc). Currently only setting the values directly. 
// - Starry background should use pseudo random generative algorithm, for use in very large world. (consider the same for other objects)
// - Handle player death. (killscreen, respawn, etc)
// 
// - AI: rename to "controller" maybe?
// - AI: right now it is added in two places I think. One creates it, and then added in Shape. Should be added in one place only.
// - Force-class maybe? instead of the enum solution. an AI can then add multiple forces and types of forces
// - AI: flee, follow, patrol, attack, defend, random, etc


Gameplay ideas/tasks:
// - Magballs, or another similar weapon: make them sticky when they hit metal..? Highly inelastic collision when hitting enemy objects. Fully elastic on asteroids. 
//		- Expand the Hull class with this kind of stuff. Add money of some type, let user buy new hulls, weapons, etc. - "ceramic hull" (non-magnetic).. etc
// - Idea: tractor beam, but once aimed at an object, use arrows to control movement of that object, along axis of the beam - or just along x,y.. 
// - Idea: max range on laser. Led it fade from red to background. Need to reimplement the line draw function.
// - Idea: powerups! should be reasonably simple to do. Trigger checks other object, if it is user_controlled and colliding, then .. something.
// - Idea: Mag deflector! from scorched earth. (may require multiple AI on each object, don't know if Hull is the right place for it)
// - Ninjarope: add ship speed to anchor speed. Consider shooting-force same as with mag ball.
// - Make thrust level off, so it is strong when still, and zero at some point
//		- Also, make it so that it is stronger when moving in opposite direction of thrust
// - Exhaust/flames etc. 
// - Aiming laser, automatic when charging up to fire something. Make able to calculate trajectory, and create a line just long enough with a crosshair at the end

// Notes for next version:
// - determine if obj class should come back, or shapes is good enough.
// - Need to figure out how objects should be talking to each other. And structure everything neatly from the start. Probably all objects just talk to World, somehow.
// - draw up some oop diagrams, and figure out how to structure everything.
